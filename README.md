# Lily's HW6: Midterm

This game was inspired by the short Disney animation movie called Paperman, in which the paper airplanes brought the couple together. The idea of this game is to fly the plane into a window at the end of its journey by using the mouse to give it a force.

Concepts/Techniques used in the code: Singleton, event functions (`OnMouseDown`, `OnMouseDrag`, etc.), `Camera.main.WorldToScreenPoint` and `Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint`.

This game will be the foundation of my final project, in which I want to utilize the paper plane as a lead of the storytelling that guides the user to go through the narrative.
