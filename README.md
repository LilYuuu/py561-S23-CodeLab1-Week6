# Lily's HW6: Midterm

This game was inspired by the short Disney animation movie called ***Paperman***, in which the paper airplanes brought the couple together. The idea of this game is to fly the plane into a window at the end of its journey by using the mouse to give it a force.

Concepts/Techniques used in the code: Singleton, event functions (`OnMouseDown`, `OnMouseDrag`, etc.), `Camera.main.WorldToScreenPoint` and `Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint`.

This game will be the foundation of my final project, in which I want to utilize the paper plane as a lead of the storytelling that guides the user to go through the narrative.
